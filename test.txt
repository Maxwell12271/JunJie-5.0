Kilimanjaro is a snow covered mountain 19710 feet high and it is said to be the highest mountain in Africa. Its western summit is called the Masai "Ngàje Ngài" the House of God. Close to the western summit there is the dried and frozen carcass of a leopard. No one has explained what the leopard was seeking at that altitude.
"The marvellous thing is that it's painless" he said. "That's how you know when it starts."
"Is it really?"
"Absolutely. I'm awfully sorry about the odor though. That must bother you."
"Don't! Please don't."
"Look at them" he said. "Now is it sight or is it scent that brings them like that?"
The cot the man lay on was in the wide shade of a mimosa tree and as he looked out past the shade onto the glare of the plain there were three of the big birds squatted obscenely while in the sky a dozen more sailed making quickmoving shadows as they passed.
"They've been there since the day the truck broke down" he said. "Today's the first time any have lit on the ground. I watched the way they sailed very carefully at first in case I ever wanted to use them in a story. That's funny now."
"I wish you wouldn't" she said.
"I'm only talking" he said. "It's much easier if I talk. But I don't want to bother you."
"You know it doesn't bother me" she said. "It's that I've gotten so very nervous not being able to do anything. I think we might make it as easy as we can until the plane comes."
"Or until the plane doesn't come."
"Please tell me what I can do. There must be something I can do."
"You can take the leg off and that might stop it though I doubt it. Or you can shoot me. You're a good shot now. I taught you to shoot didn't I?"
"Please don't talk that way. Couldn't I read to you?"
"Read what?"
"Anything in the book bag that we haven't read."
"I can't listen to it" he said. "Talking is the easiest. We quarrel and that makes the time pass."
"I don't quarrel. I never want to quarrel. Let's not quarrel any more. No matter how nervous we get. Maybe they will be back with another truck today. Maybe the plane will come."
"I don't want to move" the man said. "There is no sense in moving now except to make it easier for you."
"That's cowardly."
"Can't you let a man die as comfortably as he can without calling him names? What's the use of slanging me?"
"You're not going to die."
"Don't be silly. I'm dying now. Ask those bastards." He looked over to where the huge filthy birds sat their naked heads sunk in the hunched feathers. A fourth planed down to run quicklegged and then waddle slowly toward the others.
"They are around every camp. You never notice them. You can't die if you don't give up."
"Where did you read that? You're such a bloody fool."
"You might think about some one else."
"For Christ's sake" he said "That's been my trade."
He lay then and was quiet for a while and looked across the heat shimmer of the plain to the edge of the bush. There were a few Tommies that showed minute and white against the yellow and far off he saw a herd of zebra white against the green of the bush. This was a pleasant camp under big trees against a hill with good water and close by a nearly dry water hole where sand grouse flighted in the mornings.
"Wouldn't you like me to read?" she asked. She was sitting on a canvas chair beside his cot. "There's a breeze coming up."
"No thanks."
"Maybe the truck will come."
"I don't give a damn about the truck."
"I do."
"You give a damn about so many things that I don't."
"Not so many Harry."
"What about a drink?"
"It's supposed to be bad for you. It said in Black's to avoid all alcohol. You shouldn't drink."
"Molo!" he shouted.
"Yes Bwana."
"Bring whiskeysoda."
"Yes Bwana."
"You shouldn't" she said. "That's what I mean by giving up. It says it's bad for you. I know it's bad for you."
"No" he said. "It's good for me."
So now it was all over he thought. So now he would never have a chance to finish it. So this was the way it ended in a bickering over a drink. Since the gangrene started in his right leg he had no pain and with the pain the horror had gone and all he felt now was a great tiredness and anger that this was the end of it. For this that now was coming he had very little curiosity. For years it had obsessed him but now it meant nothing in itself. It was strange how easy being tired enough made it.
Now he would never write the things that he had saved to write until he knew enough to write them well. Well he would not have to fail at trying to write them either. Maybe you could never write them and that was why you put them off and delayed the starting. Well he would never know now.
"I wish we'd never come" the woman said. She was looking at him holding the glass and biting her lip. "You never would have gotten anything like this in Paris. You always said you loved Paris. We could have stayed in Paris or gone anywhere. I'd have gone anywhere. I said I'd go anywhere you wanted. If you wanted to shoot we could have gone shooting in Hungary and been comfortable."
"Your bloody money" he said.
"That's not fair" she said. "It was always yours as much as mine. I left everything and I went wherever you wanted to go and I've done what you wanted to do. But I wish we'd never come here."
"You said you loved it."
"I did when you were all right. But now I hate it. I don't see why that had to happen to your leg. What have we done to have that happen to us?"
"I suppose what I did was to forget to put iodine on it when I first scratched it. Then I didn't pay any attention to it because I never infect. Then later when it got bad it was probably using that weak carbolic solution when the other antiseptics ran out that paralyzed the minute blood vessels and started the gangrene." He looked at her "What else?"
"I don't mean that."
"If we would have hired a good mechanic instead of a half baked kikuyu driver he would have checked the oil and never burned out that bearing in the truck."
"I don't mean that."
"If you hadn't left your own people your goddamned Old Westbury Saratoga Palm Beach people to take me on–"
"Why I loved you. That's not fair. I love you now. I'll always love you. Don't you love me?"
"No" said the man. "I don't think so. I never have."
"Harry what are you saying? You're out of your head."
"No. I haven't any head to go out of."
"Don't drink that" she said. "Darling please don't drink that. We have to do everything we can."
"You do it" he said. "I'm tired."
  
Now in his mind he saw a railway station at Karagatch and he was standing with his pack and that was the headlight of the SimplonOrient cutting the dark now and he was leaving Thrace then after the retreat. That was one of the things he had saved to write with in the morning at breakfast looking out the window and seeing snow on the mountains in Bulgaria and Nansen's Secretary asking the old man if it were snow and the old man looking at it and saying No that's not snow. It's too early for snow. And the Secretary repeating to the other girls No you see. It's not snow and them all saying It's not snow we were mistaken. But it was the snow all right and he sent them on into it when he evolved exchange of populations. And it was snow they tramped along in until they died that winter.
It was snow too that fell all Christmas week that year up in the Gauertal that year they lived in the woodcutter's house with the big square porcelain stove that filled half the room and they slept on mattresses filled with beech leaves the time the deserter came with his feet bloody in the snow. He said the police were right behind him and they gave him woolen socks and held the gendarmes talking until the tracks had drifted over.
In Schrunz on Christmas day the snow was so bright it hurt your eyes when you looked out from the weinstube and saw every one coming home from church. That was where they walked up the sleighsmoothed urineyellowed road along the river with the steep pine hills skis heavy on the shoulder and where they ran that great run down the glacier above the Madlenerhaus the snow as smooth to see as cake frosting and as light as powder and he remembered the noiseless rush the speed made as you dropped down like a bird.
They were snowbound a week in the Madlenerhaus that time in the blizzard playing cards in the smoke by the lantern light and the stakes were higher all the time as Herr Lent lost more. Finally he lost it all. Everything the skischule money and all the season's profit and then his capital. He could see him with his long nose picking up the cards and then opening "Sans Voir." There was always gambling then. When there was no snow you gambled and when there was too much you gambled. He thought of all the time in his life he had spent gambling.
But he had never written a line of that nor of that cold bright Christmas day with the mountains showing across the plain that Barker had flown across the lines to bomb the Austrian officers' leave train machinegunning them as they scattered and ran. He remembered Barker afterwards coming into the mess and starting to tell about it. And how quiet it got and then somebody saying "You bloody murderous bastard."
Those were the same Austrians they killed then that he skied with later. No not the same. Hans that he skied with all that year had been in the KaiserJ?gers and when they went hunting hares together up the little valley above the sawmill they had talked of the fighting on Pasubio and of the attack on Pertica and Asalone and he had never written a word of that. Nor of Monte Corno nor the Siete Commum nor of Arsiedo.
How many winters had he lived in the Voralberg and the Arlberg? It was four and then he remembered the man who had the fox to sell when they had walked into Bludenz that time to buy presents and the cherrypit taste of good kirsch the fastslipping rush of running powdersnow on crust singing "Hi! Ho! said Rolly!" as you ran down the last stretch to the steep drop taking it straight then running the orchard in three turns and out across the ditch and onto the icy road behind the inn. Knocking your bindings loose kicking the skis free and leaning them up against the wooden wall of the inn the lamplight coming from the window where inside in the smoky newwine smelling warmth they were playing the accordion.
  
"Where did we stay in Paris?" he asked the woman who was sitting by him in a canvas chair now in Africa.
"At the Crillon. You know that."
"Why do I know that?"
"That's where we always stayed."
"No. Not always."
"There and at the Pavillion HenriQuatre in St. Germain. You said you loved it there."
"Love is a dunghill" said Harry. "And I'm the cock that gets on it to crow."
"If you have to go away" she said "is it absolutely necessary to kill off everything you leave behind? I mean do you have to take away everything? Do you have to kill your horse and your wife and burn your saddle and your armour?"
"Yes" he said. "Your damned money was my armour. My Swift and my Armour."
"Don't."
"All right. I'll stop that. I don't want to hurt you."
"It's a little bit late now."
"All right then. I'll go on hurting you. It's more amusing. The only thing I ever really liked to do with you I can't do now."
"No that's not true. You liked to do many things and everything you wanted to do I did."
"Oh for Christ sake stop bragging will you?"
He looked at her and saw her crying.
"Listen" he said. "Do you think that it is fun to do this? I don't know why I'm doing it. It's trying to kill to keep yourself alive I imagine. I was all right when we started talking. I didn't mean to start this and now I'm crazy as a coot and being as cruel to you as I can be. Don't pay any attention darling to what I say. I love you really. You know I love you. I've never loved any one else the way I love you."
He slipped into the familiar lie he made his bread and butter by.
"You're sweet to me."
"You bitch" he said. "You rich bitch. That's poetry. I'm full of poetry now. Rot and poetry. Rotten poetry."
"Stop it. Harry why do you have to turn into a devil now?"
"I don't like to leave anything" the man said. "I don't like to leave things behind."
  
It was evening now and he had been asleep. The sun was gone behind the hill and there was a shadow all across the plain and the small animals were feeding close to camp quick dropping heads and switching tails he watched them keeping well out away from the bush now. The birds no longer waited on the ground. They were all perched heavily in a tree. There were many more of them. His personal boy was sitting by the bed.
"Memsahib's gone to shoot" the boy said. "Does Bwana want?"
"Nothing."
She had gone to kill a piece of meat and knowing how he liked to watch the game she had gone well away so she would not disturb this little pocket of the plain that he could see. She was always thoughtful he thought. On anything she knew about or had read or that she had ever heard.
It was not her fault that when he went to her he was already over. How could a woman know that you meant nothing that you said that you spoke only from habit and to be comfortable? After he no longer meant what he said his lies were more successful with women than when he had told them the truth.
It was not so much that he lied as that there was no truth to tell. He had had his life and it was over and then he went on living it again with different people and more money with the best of the same places and some new ones.
You kept from thinking and it was all marvellous. You were equipped with good insides so that you did not go to pieces that way the way most of them had and you made an attitude that you cared nothing for the work you used to do now that you could no longer do it. But in yourself you said that you would write about these people about the very rich that you were really not of them but a spy in their country that you would leave it and write of it and for once it would be written by some one who knew what he was writing of. But he would never do it because each day of not writing of comfort of being that which he despised dulled his ability and softened his will to work so that finally he did no work at all. The people he knew now were all much more comfortable when he did not work. Africa was where he had been happiest in the good time of his life so he had come out here to start again. They had made this safari with the minimum of comfort. There was no hardship but there was no luxury and he had thought he could get back into training that way. That in some way he could work the fat off his soul the way a fighter went into the mountains to work and train in order to burn it out of his body.
She had liked it. She said she loved it. She loved anything that was exciting that involved a change of scene where there were new people and where things were pleasant. And he had felt the illusion of returning strength of will to work. Now if this was how it ended and he knew it was he must not turn like some snake biting itself because its back was broken. It wasn't this woman's fault. If it had not been she it would have been another. If he lived by a lie he should try to die by it. He heard a shot beyond the hill.
She shot very well this good this rich bitch this kindly caretaker and destroyer of his talent. Nonsense. He had destroyed his talent himself. Why should he blame this woman because she kept him well? He had destroyed his talent by not using it by betrayals of himself and what he believed in by drinking so much that he blunted the edge of his perceptions by laziness by sloth and by snobbery by pride and by prejudice by hook and by crook. What was this? A catalogue of old books? What was his talent anyway? It was a talent all right but instead of using it he had traded on it. It was never what he had done but always what he could do. And he had chosen to make his living with something else instead of a pen or a pencil. It was strange too wasn't it that when he fell in love with another woman that woman should always have more money than the last one? But when he no longer was in love when he was only lying as to this woman now who had the most money of all who had all the money there was who had had a husband and children who had taken lovers and been dissatisfied with them and who loved him dearly as a writer as a man as a companion and as a proud possession it was strange that when he did not love her at all and was lying that he should be able to give her more for her money than when he had really loved.
We must all be cut out for what we do he thought. However you make your living is where your talent lies. He had sold vitality in one form or another all his life and when your affections are not too involved you give much better value for the money. He had found that out but he would never write that now either. No he would not write that although it was well worth writing.
Now she came in sight walking across the open towards the camp. She was wearing jodhpurs and carrying her rifle.
The two boys had a Tommie slung and they were coming along behind her. She was still a goodlooking woman he thought and she had a pleasant body. She had a great talent and appreciation for the bed she was not pretty but he liked her face she read enormously liked to ride and shoot and certainly she drank too much. Her husband had died when she was still a comparatively young woman and for a while she had devoted herself to her two justgrown children who did not need her and were embarrassed at having her about to her stable of horses to books and to bottles. She liked to read in the evening before dinner and she drank Scotch and soda while she read. By dinner she was fairly drunk and after a bottle of wine at dinner she was usually drunk enough to sleep.
That was before the lovers. After she had the Iovers she did not drink so much because she did not have to be drunk to sleep. But the lovers bored her. She had been married to a man who had never bored her and these people bored her very much.
Then one of her two children was killed in a plane crash and after that was over she did not want the lovers and drink being no anaesthetic she had to make another life. Suddenly she had been acutely frightened of being alone. But she wanted someone that she respected with her.
It had begun very simply. She liked what he wrote and she had always envied the life he led. She thought he did exactly what he wanted to. The steps by which she had acquired him and the way in which she had finally fallen in love with him were all part of a regular progression in which she had built herself a new life and he had traded away what remained of his old life.
He had traded it for security for comfort too there was no denying that and for what else? He did not know. She would have brought him anything he wanted. He knew that.
She was a damned nice woman too. He would as soon be in bed with her as anyone rather with her because she was richer because she was very pleasant and appreciative and because she never made scenes. And now this life that she had built again was coming to a term because he had not used iodine two weeks ago when a thorn had scratched his knee as they moved forward trying to photograph a herd of waterbuck standing their heads up peering while their nostrils searched the air their ears spread wide to hear the first noise that would send them rushing into the bush.
They had bolted too before he got the picture.
Here she came now.
He turned his head on the cot to look toward her. 'Hello' he said.
'I shot a Tommy ram' she told him. 'He'll make you good broth and I'll have them mash some potatoes with the Klim. How do you feel?'
'Much better.'
'Isn't that lovely? You know I thought perhaps you would. You were sleeping when I left.'
'I had a good sleep. Did you walk far?'
'No. Just around behind the hill. I made quite a good shot on the Tommy.'
'You shoot marvellously you know.'
'I love it. I've loved Africa. Really. If you're all right it's the most fun that I've ever had. You don't know the fun it's been to shoot with you. I've loved the country.'
'I love it too. Darling you don't know how marvellous it is to see you feeling better. I couldn't stand it when you felt that way. You won't talk to me like that again will you? Promise me?'
'No' he said. 'I don't remember what I said.'
'You don't have to destroy me. Do you? I'm only a middleaged woman who loves you and wants to do what you want to do. I've been destroyed two or three times already. You wouldn't want to destroy me again would you?'
'I'd like to destroy you a few times in bed' he said.
'Yes. That's the good destruction. That's the way we're made to be destroyed. The plane will be here tomorrow.'
'How do you know?'
'I'm sure. It's bound to come. The boys have the wood all ready and the grass to make the smudge. I went down and looked at it again today. There's plenty of room to land and we have the smudges ready at both ends.'
'What makes you think it will come tomorrow?'
'I'm sure it will. It's overdue now. Then in town they will fix up your leg and then we will have some good destruction. Not that dreadful talking kind.'
'Should we have a drink? The sun is down.'
'Do you think you should?'
'I'm having one.'
'We'll have one together. Molo letti dui whiskysoda!' she called.
'You'd better put on your mosquito boots' he told her.
'I'll wait till I bathe . . .'
While it grew dark they drank and just before it was dark and there was no longer enough light to shoot a hyena crossed the open on his way around the hill.
'That bastard crosses there every night' the man said.
'Every night for two weeks'
'He's the one makes the noise at night. I don't mind it. They're a filthy animal though.'es the noise at night. I don't mind it. They're a filthy animal though.'
